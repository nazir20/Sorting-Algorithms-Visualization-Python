## Features

- Visualize popular sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.
- Choose from various pre-defined datasets, including random, sorted, reversed, and nearly sorted data.
- Adjust the speed of the visualization to observe the sorting process in real-time or faster.
- Step through the sorting process one step at a time or let it run continuously.
- Pause, resume, and reset the visualization as needed.
- Interactive user interface to control the visualization.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Pygame library (https://www.pygame.org)
