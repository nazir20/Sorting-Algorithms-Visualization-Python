## Features

- üéØ Visualize popular sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.
- üìä Choose from various pre-defined datasets, including random, sorted, reversed, and nearly sorted data.
- ‚è±Ô∏è Adjust the speed of the visualization to observe the sorting process in real-time or faster.
- ‚èØÔ∏è Step through the sorting process one step at a time or let it run continuously.
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Pause, resume, and reset the visualization as needed.
- üñ•Ô∏è Interactive user interface to control the visualization.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ or higher
- Tkinter library (https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)

## Getting Started:
